This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary
This project is deployed at https://gaowujian.github.io/progress-bar-deployment/.

All of requirements have been met.
In terms of responsive design, we have several breakpoints for the main div.
In terms of test, we have the jest test written in App.test.js,  the simple snapshot testing
In terms of linting tools, I choose prettier with my own preferred setting
In terms of styling, we choose scss. And I can write them with styled component if necessary.

## Requirements
Must read data from the endpoint
Multiple bars
One set of controls that can control each bar on the fly
Can't go under 0
Can go over limit (defined in API), but limit the bar itself and change its colour
Display usage amount, centered
Write tests for your code (hint: TDD strongly preferred)
Implement a responsive solution: testing it on mobile, tablet, etc. Getting it working nicely.
Animate the bar change, make sure it works well when you tap buttons quickly.
Version control (git)
Once complete publish your code to github, bitbucket or other git based source control.

## Bonus points for implementing "production quality" code, using practices such as:

Setting it up as a project
Setting up some automated tools
Linting, code quality, etc
JavaScript/CSS minification, packaging, etc
Using a CSS preprocessor like SASS/SCSS
Styling it to a production quality level

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
